UIC CS251 Assignment: Personality Quiz that presents a series of questions, and determines which fictional character the user is most similar to.

Project Summary:
This project resembles a personality quiz that can be found on social media. It presents the user with a series of statements and asks how much you agree with each of them. At the end, you’re given your classification – whether that’s which Hogwarts house you’re in, which Game of Thrones character you most resemble, or even weirder things like which sandwich best represents you.

Many personality quizzes – including this one – are based on a what’s called the five factor model. In that model, personalities are described by giving numbers (positive or negative) in five different categories with the handy acronym “OCEAN:” openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. As you take the personality quiz and answer questions, the computer updates your scores in these five categories based on how you answer each question. Your score in each category begins at zero and is then adjusted in response to your answers. At the end of the quiz, the program reports the fictional character whose scores are most similar to yours.
